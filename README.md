# Instructions

Progress through the peaceful forest, but beware of spiky grass! In the event that anything unexpected occurs, remain calm by avoiding blue mushrooms and foliage. Move using arrow keys, and jump with up arrow or space.

# Approach
This was my first foray into platforming, a game genre very dear to me. I began development by creating an general map composed of various tilesets, then imported that into Phaser. At this point I integrated player controls and collision into the world, and then began adding features such as player animations, moving platforms, win conditions, and sound/camera triggers.

# Timeline
As of December 2, 2019 this game is in development whilst enrolled in General Assembly's SEI program.

As of December 3, 2019 successfully created and imported Tiled map, imported spritesheet with animations and implemented cursor controls.

As of December 4, 2019 implemented parallax backgrounds, death via spike collision and moving platform tweens.

As of December 5, 2019 finalized map events and sounds.

If I had more time I would...
Introduce fireballs for increased difficulty.
